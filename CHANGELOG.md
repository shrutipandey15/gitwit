## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- **AI-Powered Test Generation**: Added a context menu command ("CodeCritter: Generate Tests") to automatically generate a complete test file for a selected code block or an entire file.
- **Unified Intelligent Refactoring**: Implemented a single, powerful command ("CodeCritter: Intelligently Refactor") that refactors either a selection or an entire file, providing a detailed report on the changes and suggesting alternative architectural patterns.
- **Full-File Documentation Generation**: Added a "CodeCritter: Generate File Documentation" command to create comprehensive Markdown documentation for the active file.
- **Project-Aware README Generation**: Added a "CodeCritter: Generate Project README" command to the Command Palette, which analyzes the project's `package.json`, file structure, and entry point to generate a complete `README.md`.

### Changed
- **Smarter Commit Assistant**: The commit assistant is now more precise, staging only the specific changed file (`git add <file>`) instead of all files (`git add .`).
- **Improved Commit Quality Gate**: The commit assistant now includes a quality gate and will not trigger if the saved file contains any diagnostics with an "Error" severity, preventing suggestions for broken code.

- **Simplified Architecture**: All AI processing logic has been integrated into the extension.ts file, eliminating the need for external dependencies
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can now install and use CodeCritter immediately without any additional setup or server configuration

### Removed
- **Backend Server Dependency**: Removed the requirement for a separate Node.js Express.js backend server
- **Complex Setup Process**: Eliminated the need for users to run and maintain a separate backend service

### Fixed
- **Command Not Found Error**: Fixed a critical bug where the Start Review command would fail after the project was renamed.

### Technical Details
