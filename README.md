# 🐾 CodeCritter: Your AI Code Review Companion

Ever wish you had a second pair of eyes on your code before the real, human code review? Tired of those little nitpicks that always seem to slip through, or that sinking feeling when you push code you're not 100% confident in?

That's exactly why I built CodeCritter. It's an AI-powered sidekick that lives in your VS Code editor and acts as your personal code reviewer, documentation assistant, and refactoring partner. It's here to help you ship better code with less stress.

## 🎬 See It in Action

## ✨ What's in the Toolbox?

CodeCritter isn't just a linter; it's a full suite of tools designed to automate the tedious parts of coding so you can focus on the fun parts.

**The Hybrid Reviewer** 🤖 The moment you save a file, you get the best of both worlds. An instant ESLint check catches common mistakes, followed by a deeper AI analysis that looks at logic, potential bugs, and architecture.

**The Persona Selector** 🎭 Tired of dry, robotic feedback? Click the persona name in the status bar and choose who reviews your code. Get roasted by the Sarcastic Reviewer, get a lesson from the Strict Tech Lead, or get some encouragement from the Supportive Mentor.

**The Intelligent Refactor-Bot** 🪄 Highlight a function or right-click anywhere in a file to run the smart refactoring. The AI will rewrite your code to be cleaner and more efficient, providing a detailed report on the changes and suggesting even better architectural patterns.

**The Test Generator** 🧪 Right-click on a function or file and let the AI generate a complete test file for you using modern testing frameworks like Jest.

**The Documentation Drone** 📝 Generate documentation at any level. Create professional docstrings for a single function, generate comprehensive Markdown docs for an entire file, or even generate a complete `README.md` for your project from the command palette.

**The Code Explainer** 🤔 Highlight a confusing block of legacy code, right-click, and select "Explain This Code" to get a simple, plain-English explanation in seconds.

**Time to Document** She pastes the function into the CodeCritter panel and clicks Generate Docstring. A perfect, professional docstring appears.

**Getting a Second Opinion** Before moving on, she clicks Get Manual Review. The AI provides a full report with a "Production Risk" assessment. ✅ All clear!

### 🌙 End of Day: Wrapping Up

**A Perfect Commit, Every Time** Just as Alex is about to type git commit, CodeCritter suggests a perfectly formatted message. She clicks the "Commit" button, and her work is staged and committed instantly.

**Bonus: A Change of Pace** For fun, Alex clicks the persona name in the status bar. Tomorrow, she's rolling with the Sarcastic Reviewer. Code reviews just got a lot more interesting.

## 🎯 The Vision (Our Roadmap)

CodeCritter is just getting started. The goal is to evolve it into a full "Code-Forge" that actively helps you write and refactor code, not just review it.

- [x] **The Refactor-Bot 9000**: Programmatically refactor code to modernize JavaScript and extract clean functions.
- [x] **The Boilerplate Obliterator**: Generate unit tests.
- [x] **The Documentation Drone**: Generate full-file documentation, not just snippets.
- [ ] **Create TypeScript types from JSON**.
- [ ] **Support for More AIs**: Add OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, and others.
